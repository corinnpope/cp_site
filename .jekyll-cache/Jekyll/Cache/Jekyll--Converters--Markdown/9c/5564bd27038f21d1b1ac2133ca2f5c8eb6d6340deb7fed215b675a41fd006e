I"<p>Speckled is almost ready to launch as an MVP. It still needs some little things but I’d say 95% of the MVP work is complete.</p>

<p><em>And I’m terrified of launching.</em></p>

<p>It’s very much an MVP. It doesn’t have a ton of features. In fact, I’m afraid it has too few for it to really grab people and make them excited. What if it’s underwhelming to most people? What if it doesn’t actually help anyone other than me? What if people check it out and never come back?</p>

<p>I know that it’s not going to be a perfect solution for everyone.</p>

<h4 id="i-will-not-take-it-personally">I will not take it personally</h4>

<p>Even if people like it, I’m still going to receive less than positive feedback at one point or another. I suppose I’m OK with it but still something about it puts a pit in my stomach. Not taking things personally is something I’ve really had to work on over the last few years and this is going to be a huge test of that.</p>

<p>I know I’ll survive. I’m going to feel the fear anyways. I may as well feel it and do something about it rather than not do anything about it and still feel it anyways.</p>

<p>I guess this is why the advice for so many entrepreneurs is “just do it”. Maybe they should rephrase it more often to “just do it, but scared”.</p>

<h4 id="so-what-am-i-gonna-do-about-it">So what am I gonna do about it?</h4>

<p>Anyways, that’s enough talking about fear. The next obvious question is…what am I going to do about it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’m going to wrap up the last few engineering tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m going to go to that launch list I’ve been building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I’m going to ask every person on it one by one to go ahead and try it out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If they don’t like it, I’ll ask them why not and keep iterating. If they do like it, then I’ll be more confident about reaching out to strangers or even testing advertising.</p>

<p>Then I’m going to launch.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>
