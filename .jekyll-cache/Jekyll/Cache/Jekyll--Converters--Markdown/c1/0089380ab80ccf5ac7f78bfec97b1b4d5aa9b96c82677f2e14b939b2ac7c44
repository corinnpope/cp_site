<p>I always say I‚Äôm going to be better about blogging consistently. Yet here I am, over a year later from my last post‚Ä¶finally getting around to writing another one.</p>

<p>Let me catch you up.</p>

<p>A lot has happened in the last year.</p>

<p>Some things haven‚Äôt changed. Like working on things I love, taking time to stay fit, going camping, traveling to new places, and enjoying life.</p>

<p>Other things <em>have</em> changed. Since the last time I checked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I realized the startup I was working on was not going to work (for a variety of reasons)</li>
  <li>I moved from downtown Austin to Hill Country (and picked up some cats and chickens along the way)</li>
  <li>I took a contracting gig at a startup and am moving to a full-time role (which I‚Äôm surprisingly cool with)</li>
</ul>

<p>A year ago I was paying someone to pair with me (not that that‚Äôs a bad thing) and struggling to find customers. Now I pinch myself when I wake up and realize that someone is paying me to write code for most of the day while taking a ride on a rocketship.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also 
get to learn about wine in the process. I loved wine before. I love it even more now.</p>

<p>Although it has ruined cardbordeaux for me forever. My wallet does not like that part.</p>

<p>The other week when travelling, I even got the feeling of wanting to be home. That was a new one for me.</p>

<p>My FOMO is now gone, along with the pandemic. Good riddance. I won‚Äôt miss either of those.</p>

<p>Obviously there‚Äôs been more to my year than just those highlights, but those are the most significant points I can recall. Other small things include
buying my first vehicle ever totally on my own (and only the second one I‚Äôve ever owned), running an ultramarathon, and buying a casita travel trailer to hit the road with.</p>

<p>Writing this now makes me remember how much fun it can be to sit and write into the void that it is the internet.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure why I don‚Äôt blog consistently even though I know that I enjoy it when I do it. I suppose my daily journaling session is enough to fulfill my urge to write.</p>

<p>I also learned this year I am a big ‚Äúavoider‚Äù. So I‚Äôve come up with a few mantras to overcome that - like asking ‚Äúwhat needs to be done?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the smallest action to take to do that‚Äù. It is still a struggle on some days.</p>

<p>Still ‚Äî I know practicing writing in public is beneficial and I know I should do it more. But I‚Äôll be honest - sometimes after a long day of work, all I want to do is curl up on the couch with a good book, a glass of wine, and my cats. Not write.</p>

<p>Anyways - until next year (or maybe sooner, depending on how I feel). Hugs and kisses.</p>
