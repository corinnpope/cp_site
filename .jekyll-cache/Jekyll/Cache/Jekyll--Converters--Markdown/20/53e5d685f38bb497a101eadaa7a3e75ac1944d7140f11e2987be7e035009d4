<p>June 24, 2020</p>

<p>Speckled is almost ready to launch as an MVP. It still needs some little things but Iâ€™d say 95% of the MVP work is complete.</p>

<p>And Iâ€™m terrified of launching.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very much an MVP. It doesnâ€™t have a ton of features. In fact, Iâ€™m afraid it has too few for it to really grab people and make them excited. What if itâ€™s underwhelming to most people? What if it doesnâ€™t actually help anyone other than me? What if people check it out and never come back?</p>

<p>I know that itâ€™s not going to be a perfect solution for everyone.</p>

<p>Even if people like it, Iâ€™m still going to receive less than positive feedback at one point or another. I suppose Iâ€™m OK with it but still something about it puts a pit in my stomach. Not taking things personally is something Iâ€™ve really had to work on over the last few years and this is going to be a huge test of that.</p>

<p>I know Iâ€™ll survive. Iâ€™m going to feel the fear anyways. I may as well feel it and do something about it rather than not do anything about it and still feel it anyways.</p>

<p>I guess this is why the advice for so many entrepreneurs is â€œjust do itâ€. Maybe they should rephrase it to â€œjust do it, but scaredâ€.</p>

<p>Anyways, thatâ€™s enough talking about fear. The next obvious question isâ€¦what am I going to do about it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m going to wrap up the last few engineering tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m going to go to that launch list Iâ€™ve been building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And Iâ€™m going to ask every person on it one by one to go ahead and try it out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If they donâ€™t like it, Iâ€™ll ask them why not and keep iterating. If they do like it, then Iâ€™ll be more confident about reaching out to strangers or even testing advertising.</p>

<p>Then Iâ€™m going to launch.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s do this.</p>
