I"g<p>In short, no.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions, but generally speaking, writers did not go to design school. It’s unlikely you want them designing your emails.</p>

<p>Plain text? Sure, most of us can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add bullets</li>
  <li><strong>create bolded headlines</strong></li>
  <li><em>italicize for emphasis</em></li>
  <li>and create an email that POPS…<em>without</em> the need for beautiful backgrounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>But full HTML emails with code and graphics are tough. You have tables. You have CSS. You have images that need serving and hosting.</p>

<p>Not to mention making sure it’s just right on mobile, tablets, and desktops. That’s a lot of skillsets we didn’t learn in “copywriting school”.</p>

<p>Now for the exceptions. Here’s when you should expect your email creator to design as well:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>You’re hiring an agency</strong> that specializes in complete email creation</li>
  <li>You’re hiring a very expensive <strong>contractor that has confirmed they can do all of this</strong> for you (and hopefully has a portfolio to back it up)</li>
  <li><strong>You’re OK with a “good enough” email from your copywriter</strong> and realize it will take many extra hours for them to do the additional work of designing, coding, and testing the emails.</li>
  <li>You have <strong>pre-existing templates that are easy</strong> to do and just need the text copy+pasta’d in</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Please do not expect your writer to design a full HTML email from scratch. If you do need all of this, remember it’s likely to cost more.</p>
