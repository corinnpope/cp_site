<p>Iâ€™m a girl from Austin, TX who happens to love everything product related. â€¨</p>

<hr />

<p>I was born in the great garden state (a.k.a New Jersey) to an artist and a contractor. I guess you could say I picked up on the love to create pretty and practical things from them from an early age. I played a lot of spots, begrudgingly played a couple of instruments, and had a pretty standard suburban childhood that Iâ€™m very thankful for.</p>

<p>I went into college (JMU) as a business major, but quickly changed my mind when I saw how cool some of the stuff coming out of the ISAT department was during orientation. I changed majors real quick.</p>

<p>That led me to my first job out of college in IT consulting (which I hated), which then led me down a path of â€˜screw endless status meetings I want to build thingsâ€™.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s just say Iâ€™ve never looked back.</p>

<p>First up after the corporate gig was building a small info products business, then taking a product management apprenticeship, and now building my own thing.</p>

<p>I love listening to customers and prioritizing ruthlessly and with their experience in mind. Iâ€™m not afraid to cut features after theyâ€™ve been built or say no to stakeholders who want stuff that wonâ€™t have a positive impact on the customer. Sorry not sorry.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m currently building Speckled â€” a tool to help product managers get a hold of their bazillion and one feature requets.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not staring at my computer screen, you can find me trail running on the Greenbelt, catching up on a good book, or checking out all that Austin has to offer.</p>
