I"„	<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Iâ€™m a full-stack product person who loves to write.</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><br />
Iâ€™ve done every job in B2B SaaS. Customer support, product management, UI/UX design, sales, engineering, content marketing, SEO and copywriting â€” you name it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve PMâ€™d on a product with net negative churn, another with 80% product-market fit, and another that has gone on to make six figures in revenue. Iâ€™ve ran the product team at a company with $10M in revenues a year, plus worked as a developer on multiple products for both myself and others. In other words, I know SaaS.</p>

<p>No matter what the role though, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the writing parts of it. Especially technical writing and copy writing.</p>

<p>Why writing? Clear writing is clear thinking. And showing clear thought means you know your stuff. Itâ€™s a way of expressing empathy.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not writing, I either have my nose stuck in a book, my hands in a pair of gardening gloves, or my feet in a pair of trail runners.

<p><strong>Everything style</strong>: Keep it simple. Donâ€™t use more than needed.</p>

<p><strong>Communication style</strong>: Friendly and casual. Sometimes quirky.</p>

<p><strong>Writing style</strong>: Chameleon. I write to your brand voice.</p>

<p><strong>Design style</strong>: The less design, the better.</p>

<p><strong>Programming style</strong>: Intuitive - I jump into things and see where it takes me.</p>

<p><strong>Management style</strong>: Trusting. Human. I believe people are fundamentally good.

<p>No, not chicken butt. Although I do take care of 7 of them in my backyard.</p>
