<p>June 12, 2020</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and just had an insatiable urge to write. About what Iâ€™m not sure, so letâ€™s see how the words flow out of my brain this morning. Stream of consciousnessâ€¦letâ€™s go!</p>

<h2 id="texas-covid-19-cases-are-risingfast">Texas Covid-19 cases are risingâ€¦fast</h2>

<p>Texas is currently seeing a massive spike in covid-19 cases. Weâ€™re on a three day streak of record highs. If we have to go back into lockdown Iâ€™m going to be super bummed and a little bit pissed.</p>

<p>Personally, I donâ€™t really go anywhere â€œnormalâ€ anymore. No library. No coffee shops. No restaurants. No Target runs. Nada. The only thing I still do on occasion is go to Trader Joeâ€™s. And even then, a TJâ€™s run mean a mask and post-shopping shower. I do run outside, although on the commute through my building to the path I still wear a mask.</p>

<p>Still, thereâ€™s something heavier about being under official lockdown, even if without it you still follow all the â€œrulesâ€.</p>

<h2 id="datagrid-successes-kinda">Datagrid successes (kinda)</h2>
<p>Anyways, enough with the rant and negativity. Letâ€™s talk about something positiveâ€¦.</p>

<p>I had been struggling with this darn Vue datagrid I have in my app for months now. I knew at the beginning it was going to be the hardest part of building, but I didnâ€™t realize just how hard it would be.</p>

<p>For experienced programmers, itâ€™d probably be a breeze. Maybe itâ€™d take them a week. But since Iâ€™m pretty new to Javascript <em>and</em> vue, it was an exercise in patience and persistence thatâ€™s lasted for many months.</p>

<p>The table pulls from multiple database tables, has lots of nested JSON, requires sort, search, editing, and deleting.</p>

<p>It look me embarassingly long to go from concept and trying to figure out if this needs javascript (I was holding out hope in the beginning) to actually getting it to a place where I can use it myself.</p>

<p>Butâ€¦now I can use it myself! And Iâ€™m using it to figure out my TODO list and rank it in order of priority.</p>

<p>Up next are fixing an annoying roadmap bug that used to not be there. Then I need to start think about how onboarding is going to work.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s actually INCREDIBLY helpful. Now I just add things to my TODO list, rank them, and pick things from the top and work my way down.</p>

<p>I get what they say about eating your own dogfood. Doing so has helped me tweak a number of things already and Iâ€™m sure will help me in the future.</p>

<h2 id="planning-out-user-onboarding">Planning out user onboarding</h2>

<p>About onboarding thoughâ€¦</p>

<p>I think the â€œahaâ€ moment for people will be when they add their first 3-5 items and realize that what they thought may be â€œtopâ€ priority may not be. The question then is how do I get them to that point as fast as humanly possible? And then keep them coming back when they have more items to add?</p>

<p>Part of the things that are required to get them there include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>having a scoring model (default RICE one created at account creation)</li>
  <li>creating a board (have a default board on upon account creation)</li>
  <li>adding items (havenâ€™t made any defaults, maybe I should add at least one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m wondering if I should add some default items as kind of a meta onboarding. Let people edit them. Let them archive them. Show them on the roadmap.</p>

<p>Would it be just one item? Or should there be a bunch of tasks?</p>

<p>Or maybe a quick demo video would be helpful.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also tossed around the idea of having a more detailed setup process that lets users select from multiple scoring models or create their own right after signup. There would be different options depending on what stage theyâ€™re in and what theyâ€™re looking for.</p>

<p>BUT, making them create their own score and <em>then</em> add items may be too complex. What if they get stuck on the scoring stuff and never add itemsâ€¦even if a custom scoring methodology would be better for them longer term?!</p>

<p>If they add items to the default model and <em>then</em> customize their scoring model, theyâ€™ll probably have a better intuition as to how the application works and how to handle adding scoring methods. I think thatâ€™s probably the better way to go.</p>

<p>Plus, itâ€™ll be fastest to the aha moment.</p>

<p>Both are worth testing out though once there are enough users to draw some conclusions.</p>

<p>Onboarding plan: Iâ€™m going to add a default item and/or items and give them the option of watching a quick onboarding video.</p>

<p>Guess I need to record a demo video.</p>

<h2 id="getting-them-to-come-back">Getting them to come back</h2>

<p>How will I get them to come back after theyâ€™ve prioritized their list?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not realy a fan of roadmaps with strict dates. I wonâ€™t be able to ping them on things that are coming up or are â€œdueâ€ soon.</p>

<p>Could I see if theyâ€™ve integrated with anything and ping them when theyâ€™ve added something that may also need to be added to Speckled? Perhaps. Although depending on the user, I feel like this may overwhelm then with notifications and thatâ€™s no beuno either.</p>

<p>I could go with the variable rewards system in the â€œHookedâ€ book model. Although it feels a little dirty. But then again, weâ€™re all PMs here so we all know the game and how to turn it off if we donâ€™t like it. Still.</p>

<p>Maybe broadcast roadmap changes to slack.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d also like to add custom backgrounds. Thatâ€™d be fun.</p>

<p>Or a little celebration when they mark something as done or archive something.</p>

<h2 id="am-i-getting-ahead-of-myself">Am I getting ahead of myself?</h2>

<p>Little things. So many little things. They all need wrapping up.</p>

<p>The last 10% of this project is taking 90% of the time. Itâ€™s so frustrating.</p>

<p>There are bugs in the datagrid. If you select more than one item to edit, you can only save one item. Anything else will be overwritten.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a bug in the roadmap. If you drag a story away and that old column is now empty, it just disappears.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a bug in bulk importing. The form only appears after refresh.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a bug in asana imports. Sometimes they donâ€™t work.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t gotten around to changing the active class in the selection menu. It always looks like youâ€™re on the dashboard.</p>

<p>Still, I think itâ€™s good to think about big things like onboarding and retention in parallel with these little things.</p>

<p>Just so many little things! And so many big things too!</p>

<h2 id="end-ramble">End ramble</h2>

<p>I guess I should stop rambling and get back to work. That was oddly therapeutic though.</p>
