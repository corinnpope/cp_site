<p>Funnels don’t have to be complex. The simple, <strong>minimum viable funnel</strong> is all you need to start driving traffic to a new or existing product.</p>

<p>With this package, you’ll get everything you need to get the attention of a prospect, convince them to give you their email, show them what you have to offer, and follow up with them via email.</p>

<p>I’ll deliver all the copy, pages &amp; setup for your four step funnel, including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1 facebook ad or 3 google search ads</li>
  <li>1 landing page</li>
  <li>1 offer page or thank you page</li>
  <li>3 email welcome sequence</li>
</ol>

<p>Delivery takes between 1 and 2 weeks and includes planning, writing, editing, set up. It does not include a budget for ads, ad account setup, or design beyond basic wireframes or adding copy to a template.</p>

<p>At the end of the project, you’ll have a fully functioning funnel you can turn on.</p>

<p>To get the highest possible conversion rate, I recommend pairing this with the customer research package. If you already have customer
research completed, I’ll use that to help write copy.</p>
