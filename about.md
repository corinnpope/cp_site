# Who is Corinn Pope?

I’m a girl from Austin, TX who happens to love everything product related.

While growing up in the great Garden State of New Jersey, I played a whole lot of sports and a couple of instruments. While I may not have always been the star of the team or first chair of first (or even second) violin section, I consistently got the award for "most coachable".  


While there were definitely cooler awards to get, looking back on being "most coachable" now makes me realize I've always been someone who listens intently, asks questions, implements them, and iterates until I get it.  


Of course I can still ruthlessly prioritize, say no when needed, and problem solve on the fly, but listening and empathy are my superpowers as a product manager.  


When it comes to listening, customers are my favorite to listen to. They're really the ones who come up with great product ideas. I just guide those ideas to production. Watching those same customers then use the products we've built and get real value for them is what makes this job great.  


I'm currently in the middle of building a new product that helps product managers (so meta!). In an effort to single-task, I'm limiting my consulting availability to 10 hours a week or less at the moment.  


When I'm not building stuff, you can find me trail running on the Greenbelt, catching up on a good book, or checking out all that this great city has to offer.
