# Who is Corinn Pope?

I’m a girl from Austin, TX who happens to love everything product related.  

---

Previously, I worked as a product director at a fast-growing company. I originally applied for the role of product marketer, and landed up making my way through the roles to product director. 

However, along with that transition, I eventually found myself with little time to create. Creative energy is so important to me and I wanted to find it again. So, I started teaching myself to program. 

I had known html and css pretty well, but when it came to JS or server-side languages, I was clueless. I picked up Rails because it seemed the most intuitive to me and off I went. 

I'm currently spending most of my days learning by building and have never felt better. 

I love listening to customers and prioritizing ruthlessly and with their experience in mind. I'm not afraid to cut features after they've been built or say no to stakeholders who want stuff that won't have a positive impact on the customer. Sorry not sorry. 

I'm currently in the middle of building a new product that helps product managers (so meta!). In an effort to single-task, I'm limiting my consulting availability to 10 hours a week or less at the moment.  

When I'm not building stuff, you can find me trail running on the Greenbelt, catching up on a good book, or checking out all that this great city has to offer.
