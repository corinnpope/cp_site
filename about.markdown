# Who is Corinn Pope?

Iâ€™m a full-stack product person who likes to build fun and useful things.

---

Previously, I worked as a product director at a fast-growing company. I originally applied for the role of product marketer, and landed up making my way through the roles to product director.

However, along with that transition, I eventually found myself with little time to create. Creative energy is so important to me and I wanted to find it again. So, I started teaching myself to program.

I had known html and css pretty well, but when it came to JS or server-side languages, I was clueless. I picked up Rails because it seemed the most intuitive to me and off I went.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at vinebase.com.

I love listening to customers and prioritizing ruthlessly and with their experience in mind. I'm not afraid to cut features after they've been built or say no to stakeholders who want stuff that won't have a positive impact on the customer. Sorry not sorry.

When I'm not building stuff, you can find me trail running in Guadalupe State Park, catching up on a good book, or taking care of my chickens.
