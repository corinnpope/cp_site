# Who is Corinn Pope?

Iâ€™m a full-stack product person from central Texas

---

I was born in the great garden state (a.k.a New Jersey) to an artist and a contractor. I guess you could say I picked up on the love to create pretty and practical things from them from an early age. I played a lot of spots, begrudgingly played a couple of instruments, and had a pretty standard suburban childhood that I'm very thankful for.

I went into college (JMU) as a business major, but quickly changed my mind when I saw how cool some of the stuff coming out of the ISAT department was during orientation. I changed majors real quick.

That led me to my first job out of college in IT consulting (which I hated), which then led me down a path of 'screw endless status meetings I want to build things'.

Let's just say I've never looked back.

First up after the corporate gig was building a small info products business, then taking a product management apprenticeship that turned into a product management role, and then software engineering.

I love listening to customers and prioritizing ruthlessly and with their experience in mind. I love taking ideas for the things they need and bringing them to life through UI/UX, code, and product marketing.

When I'm not staring at my computer screen, you can find me trail running in Guadalupe State Park, catching up on a good book, or taking care of my cats and chickens.
