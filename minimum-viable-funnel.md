## The Minimum Viable Funnel

Funnels don't have to be complex. The simple, **minimum viable funnel** is all you need to start driving traffic to a new or existing product.

With this package, you'll get everything you need to get the attention of a prospect, convince them to give you their email, show them what you have to offer, and follow up with them via email.

I'll deliver all the copy, pages & setup for your four step funnel, including:
1. 1 facebook ad or 3 google search ads
2. 1 landing page
3. 1 offer page or thank you page
4. 3 email welcome sequence

Delivery takes between 1 and 2 weeks and includes planning, writing, editing, set up. It does not include a budget for ads, ad account setup, or design beyond basic wireframes or adding copy to a template.

At the end of the project, you'll have a fully functioning funnel you can turn on.

To get the highest possible conversion rate, I recommend pairing this with the customer research package. If you already have customer
research completed, I'll use that to help write copy.
