### Could you use it in a sentence, please?

I hired a conversion rate engineer to debug our funnels and now we're spending less on acquisition while getting more customers. Boom.

### Did you just make that term up?

You bet I did.

### Why do I need to add conversion rate engineering into my already long list of to-dos?

It'll save you money. Potentially boatloads of it.

Plus, it will help you better understand your customer — which will positively affect nearly every other aspect of your business.

Here's a sample leaky funnel before and after conversion rate engineering:

##### Fixing a leaky funnel

Stat | Before CRE | After CRE
Ad spend | $10K | $10K
Click through rate | 2% | 4%
Landing page conversion rate | 25%| 30%
**Cost per conversion** | **$200** | **$83**

Would you rather spend $10K and get 50 customers or 120 customers? Your pick.
